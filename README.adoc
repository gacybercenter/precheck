= System PreCheck

This project was built to file the need of being able to provide a simple
systems requirement check for remote based training. Leveraging already
existing Opensource technologies, we have added a few extra customization
to enhance those capabilities.

== Technologies
This project implements use of LibreSpeed's Speedtest project to allow for
a lightweight speedtest to be performed. This project can be found at: +

https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest

This project also implements use of jmalloc's HTML5 WebSocket Echo project
to allow for a lightweight WebSocket test to be performed. This project can
be found at: +

https://github.com/jmalloc/echo-server

== Features
The System PreCheck project provides the following overall features:

- HTML5 Browser Detection
- WebSocket Functionality Check (port 8080)
- TCP Port Checks (80) _Does not include a SSL Proxy_
- Speedtest (LibreSpeed)

The overall goal of this project is to provide a docker implementation providing an all-in-one solution for a system prechecks for remote based training that leverages Apache Guacamole for remote access.

== Installation
The `Dockerfile` is provided to build the image for PreCheck with LibreSpeed **(_Ensure to leverage your own_ `favicon.ico`)**. The `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to run the docker environment wtih two services overall:

- **PreCheck w/ LibreSpeed Container**
- **Echo WebSocket Container**

The overall design is for standalone use only, and the build steps below are
to address building an image with multiple contexts.

. Install Required Packages
[source,shell]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose containerd
----

. Clone the repository
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://gitlab.com/gacybercenter/open/precheck.git
cd precheck && git submodule update --init --recursive
----

. Build the Image
